<p class="p2">It is only within recent times that movable
chairs have become common and
indispensable. Seats of some kind must
have been used from the time when houses
were first built, but it is not until the civilization
of the last two or three centuries
had transformed the old ways of living
that we begin to find them in common use.
Representations of seats are found in the
sculptures and paintings of Egypt, Greece
and Rome, and all through the middle
ages&mdash;many of them elaborate and luxurious&mdash;but
their use was confined to the
noble and wealthy. In church furniture
chairs are familiar throughout the middle
ages, but they were usually fixed parts of
the building. The seats of the common
people were probably constructed of rude
blocks, or of single planks joined together
with little finish or skill.</p>

<p>In England, even so late as the sixteenth
century, chairs as we know them were of
so rare occurrence as to be handed down
from generation to generation, and of such
importance as to be frequently mentioned
in wills and deeds. Such chairs were of
the rudest forms, ornamented, however,
with embroideries and costly stuffs. In the
middle of the seventeenth century it was
customary even at royal banquets for all
but the king and queen to be seated upon
benches without cushions. In the reign of
Charles I., however, with the encouragement
of luxurious living, chairs became
more common among the favored classes,
and under the Commonwealth, with its levelling
of class distinctions, their use was
extended. But in the latter period the revulsion
against unnecessary ornament and
display simplified the models. With the
Restoration there was a return to the opposite
extreme. The growing taste for
ease and luxury brought into requisition
the richest fabrics obtainable, and we find
stuffed seats and backs, with Turkish embroideries
and heavily brocaded velvets.
Chairs were elaborately carved and gilded.
French furniture was imported and copied,
and the influence of Indian art, through
the recent acquisition of Bombay, can be
easily traced. Of the simpler patterns,
those made of turned spindles became common
at the beginning of the eighteenth
century. Forms were borrowed and
adapted from many sources, from France,
Spain and Holland. In the time of William
and Mary, under Dutch influence, the
seats and backs were broadened, colored
inlay introduced, and the "cabriole" legs
commonly employed, suggesting the forms
later adopted in the Chippendale period.
The strong point of English furniture was
not its originality, but its catholicity. It
was a mirror which reflected the outcome
of other times and countries in a frame of
its own.</p>

<p>The period when Chippendale appeared
on the scene seems to have been one very
favorable to the success of his enterprise.
The middle classes were already
accumulating wealth and beginning to
assume numerical and political importance.
The troubles of civil war were over,
the reigning dynasty had successfully overcome
the last attempt at revolution, and
the situation promised an age wherein the
comforts of life might again be enjoyed in
security. English trade with Holland,
doubtless very largely fostered by the
Dutch proclivities of William III., had
helped to disseminate a love for pottery
and lacquer work of the East; artificial
works were multiplying, and the middle
classes, above all, wanted for the furnishing
of their rapidly rising, substantial
dwellings something more sumptuous than
the humble simplicity of the common
Jacobean&mdash;something which would have a
taste, at least, of the luxurious extravagances
of the French reigning style.</p>

<p>English furniture of the time of Chippendale
had profited by the best of the
past and of the present. It closely resembled
the French work of Louis XIV.,
but it had reached such a stage of perfection,
though still made up of heterogeneous
elements, that it was for the first time valued
above the productions of other countries,
and was even taken abroad to be
copied, while the books of designs published
by the English cabinet-makers were
translated into other languages. In the
preface to Hepplewhite's book of designs,
published in 1789, there is this statement,
which is of interest as indicating the esteem
in which English cabinet work was
held abroad, viz.: "English taste and
workmanship have of late years been much
sought for by surrounding nations; and
the mutability of all things, but more especially
of fashions, has rendered the labours
of our predecessors in this line of
little use; nay, in this day can only tend to
mislead those foreigners who seek a knowledge
of English taste in the various articles
of household furniture."</p>

<p>Oak had been the prevailing material up
to this time, but now mahogany took its
place. An interesting account of the introduction
of mahogany for furniture is
given by Frederick Litchfield in his "History
of Furniture." He says, "Mahogany
may be said to have come into general
use subsequent to 1720, and its introduction
is asserted to have been due to the
tenacity of purpose of a Dr. Gibbon, whose
wife wanted a candle-box, an article of
common domestic use at the time. The
doctor, who had laid by in the garden of
his house in King Street, Covent Garden,
some planks sent to him by his brother, a
West Indian captain, asked the joiner to
use a part of the wood for this purpose; it
was found too tough and hard for the tools
of the period, but the doctor was not to be
thwarted, and insisted on harder-tempered
tools being found, and the task completed.
The result was the production of a candle-box
which was admired by every one. He
then ordered a bureau of the same material,
and when it was finished invited his friends
to see the new work; amongst others the
Duchess of Buckingham begged a small
piece of the precious wood, and it soon became
the fashion."</p>

<p>The Jacobean and cognate styles, consisting
fundamentally of "framing" based
on rectangular forms and decorated with
characteristic carving and turning, may be
described as essentially suitable for oak, of
which the open character of the grain forbids
any extreme minuteness of detail.
The particular qualities of the work of
Chippendale and his successors demanded,
on the other hand, the use of a very different
material. Chippendale's delicate
carving and his free use of curves, even in
constructive members of his design, could
have only been satisfactorily wrought out
in a wood of fine, hard and close grain, and
one which also possessed great lateral tenacity,
such as mahogany. It is scarcely too
much to say that, but for the introduction
of this beautiful wood the specialty in the
work of the cabinet-makers of the eighteenth
century would have been impossible.</p>

<p>Together with the refinement of design
came a perfection of construction and
workmanship which has rendered the furniture
of this period practically indestructible.
It is said that Chippendale never
carved a fret without gluing together
three thicknesses of wood with opposing
grain, and his work is so joined with
tenons and pegs that it stands as well today
as when first put together. Sheraton
devoted whole pages of his book to constructive
directions for the most simple table.
This excellence of construction, and
the eminently practical and usable character
of the best of the eighteenth century
work have been potent factors in helping
to preserve the many examples of it
which we fortunately possess today.</p>

<p>It will probably be a surprise to the
reader who has had no occasion to inquire
especially into the history of household
furniture to know that a century and a
half ago furniture makers, in England and
elsewhere, resorted to much the same
method of securing customers, by publishing
illustrated catalogues, as do our own
enterprising manufacturers. Among the
earliest of these trade catalogues, as we
now call them, was that of Thomas Chippendale,
the first edition of which was
published about 1750 (the exact date is in
doubt), and two later editions are known.
This catalogue has been reproduced in recent
years and many of the plates have
been frequently copied, until the Chippendale
designs have become familiar, and the
name applied broadly but loosely to all of
the work of the period, including a great
deal which by right has no connection
whatever with Chippendale. The illustrations
in this catalogue were elaborately engraved
on copper, and it was entitled "The
Gentleman and Cabinet Maker's Director."
It contained over two hundred engravings
of useful and decorative designs, some of
which, however, were probably never executed.
It included designs "in the most
fashionable taste" for a great variety of
furniture "calculated to improve and refine
the present taste, and suited to the
fancy and circumstances of persons in all
degrees of life." A great deal of the design
is traceable to French influence, and
may have been borrowed directly from
similar books by French cabinet-makers.</p>

<p>Of Chippendale himself little of a personal
nature is known. Both he and his
father were carvers, and it is no doubt true
that to the repute established by his father
as a basis, he added superior skill and taste,
and the shrewdness of a tradesman. It is
by no means certain, however, that in his
time, or immediately after it, his reputation
was greater than that of other cabinet-makers.
His present celebrity depends
more upon the survival and later reproduction
of his book of designs than upon any
contemporary fame. That he had refinement
of taste is proved by his designs; but
that he was anxious, above all, to secure
patrons is hardly open to question. Mr.
J. A. Heaton ("Furniture and Decoration
in England during the Eighteenth Century")
calls him a "vulgar hawker" ready
to make anything that would fill his purse.
His book, the text of which is written in
the bombastic style of the period, begins
with an explanation of the classical orders
of architecture, holding them up as the
only basis of true design in furniture; but
he later refers to certain designs "in
the Chinese manner"&mdash;which were made,
quite certainly, in response to the fashion
introduced in England by Sir William
Chambers,&mdash;as the most appropriate and
successful of his whole collection.</p>

<p>Although much of the furniture of the
middle and latter part of the eighteenth
century is wrongly attributed to Chippendale,
and he is now popularly held responsible
for many excellencies as well as many
faults which do not belong to him, the evidence
of his book goes to prove that his
work at its best was superior to that of his
contemporaries, and vastly superior to that
which either preceded or followed it.</p>

<p>Chippendale's ordinary furniture may be
conveniently classified under three heads
of very various artistic value. The first is
the pure rococo. In this class of work we
find, as Mr. Basil Champneys has happily
described it, "intemperately flowing lines,
wantonly twisting volutes, fantastic and
unmeaning forms, suggestive about equally
of organic and inorganic nature, bursting
here into a gryphon's or sphynx's head, or
there into a bunch of flowers; writhing
into a mermaid, or culminating in a trophy;
here the volutes are propped with an utterly
dissipated and abandoned Gothic shaft,
there is the ghost of a classic pediment;
here a whole piece of ruin is bodily foisted
in; a fortuitous interval is occupied by a
sportsman or a flirtation, or by the conventional
Chinaman, with an impossible
mustache and inconceivable hat. The two
sides of the design are seldom alike; symmetry
is ostentatiously avoided; everything
twists, twirls, writhes, changes, gets
distorted like the images in a dyspeptic
dream over a book of travels, from which
the reader will be glad to awake."</p>

<p>Fortunately for Chippendale's fame this
class of work forms but an insignificant
portion of the remains of his furniture now
extant&mdash;a fact which is owing in some
measure to its constructive weakness. Its
merits are purely those of a skilful carver.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 90%" ><a href="images/25.jpg">
<img src="images/25_th.jpg" alt="CHIPPENDALE CHAIRS" style="width: 80%" /></a>
</div>


<p>A second important characteristic style
was that which may be described as "fret
work." Some pieces coming under this
description, shelves and cabinets for china,
amongst others, are constructed almost
wholly of thin slabs of wood pierced with
a great variety of small patterns, many
of them very intricate. These are dainty
pieces of furniture, well suited for the
drawing-room and boudoir; and it speaks
volumes for the care and finish in the
workmanship that any of them have
been handed down to us in a perfect state
during so long an existence.</p>

<p>What is sound of the reputation that
Chippendale has earned, however, apart
from the excellence of his workmanship,
lies in the furniture coming under the last
head of our division&mdash;in pieces wherein we
find the decoration applied, a little lavishly
it is true, with a certain admixture of
straight lines and plain surfaces with
which to contrast it. In these, members
otherwise square and straight are enriched
with delicate and shallow sunk carved
work, sometimes based on geometrical patterns.
The backs of chairs, although consisting
of curved forms, have commonly a
rectilinear disposition of the principal lines,
and the curvatures of the constructional
members are so subtle and restrained that
the impression of strong wooden construction
is not wholly destroyed. The
supporting members, such as legs of tables
and chairs, are often kept straight, and the
carving, where applied, is kept so shallow
that it does not interfere with the apparent
or real capacity of the parts for the
function for which they are designed.</p>

<p>In appraising his merits it must always
be remembered that Chippendale was pre-eminently
a <i>carver</i>; and as a carver producing
work applied to objects of utility he
holds an unchallenged position.</p>

<p>Mr. K. Warren Clouston, describing the
work of this period (<i>The Architectural
Record</i>, Vol. VIII.), says: "Chippendale,
above all things, was a chairmaker, and his
chairs are full of variety, at first with the
high back, cabriole leg and claw-and-ball
foot of the so-called Dutch taste; then
rising to lighter fancies, either with vase-shaped
ornament, flowing ribbon bows, interlacing
frets of Gothic tracery. But
what matters it whether the rococo ornament
then prevailing on the continent, the
Chinese leanings of Sir William Chambers,
or Strawberry Hill Gothic were adopted,
when the different sources are blended in
one harmonious whole? We give Chippendale
the first place simply from his
book, for the squat backs and ungainly
chairs of Manwaring and the Society of
Upholsterers, and the badly designed seats
of Ince and Mayhew only serve to accentuate
the work of the master hand."</p>

</div>


<p>The chairs chosen for illustration in this
number are of the simpler patterns. It
will be seen that they have very little ornament,
and that this is almost entirely confined
to the backs, the legs being in most
cases square and plain. In the backs
the same lines occur as in those made in
the time of William III., but instead of the
frame of the back being covered with silk,
tapestry or other material, Chippendale's
are cut open with fanciful patterns. Those
with cabriole legs usually have claw feet
and a shell or leaf at the top. The chairs
in Chippendale's book are much more
elaborate than those here illustrated or
than those he ordinarily produced. This is
naturally accounted for by the desire to
induce customers to purchase the more expensive
pieces. The simple square leg
without taper is one of the distinctive
marks of Chippendale's time. Later in the
century, in the work of Hepplewhite and
others, the legs were made more tapering
and the whole chair much lighter and more
elaborately ornamented to correspond with
the Renaissance forms then in vogue. The
turned leg is rarely found, although much
used later. The shaping and ornamentation
is generally confined to the front legs.
Mahogany, as has been stated, was the
wood most used, and the ornamentation
was confined as a rule to carving. Inlay
and marquetry, brass and ormolu were employed
on other articles of furniture, but
the chairs rarely have such ornament.</p>

<p>The rococo of Chippendale's earlier
work, corresponding to the French of Louis
XV. and XVI., was succeeded by a modification
tending towards the severer Renaissance,
influenced by the designs of the architects,
Robert and James Adam, who
gave their attention to the minutest details
of interior decoration and furnishing, as
well as the larger problems of architecture.
Of Chippendale's contemporaries, Ince and
Mayhew, who also published a book of designs,
are now looked upon as most deserving
to share his fame, although there are
records of many others.</p>

<p>Hepplewhite forms a connecting link between
this period and that of the more
severe lines of Sheraton and Shearer.
Sheraton was a skilled and cultivated man
and an excellent draughtsman. Among
the subscribers to his book, "The Cabinet
Maker and Upholsterer's Drawing Book,"
published in 1793, are the names and addresses
of no less than four hundred and
fifty cabinet-makers, chairmakers and
carvers, not including musical instrument
makers, upholsterers and other kindred
trades. This gives some idea of the extent
to which such books were then employed,
and the number of makers whose work is
not now distinguishable and whose names
are lost in oblivion. Following the work
of these men came the "Empire" style introduced
in France after the French Revolution.</p>
